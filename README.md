## 📌 Overview
This project builds and trains a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images by learning spatial features such as edges, textures, and shapes.

The notebook demonstrates:

- Image dataset loading and preprocessing  
- Normalization and reshaping for CNN input  
- Building CNN architecture using convolution and pooling layers  
- Training and validating the deep learning model  
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy and loss metrics
